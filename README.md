# Your First Computer Program and Using-Variables

Practical Task 1
Follow these steps:
● Create a new Python file in the Dropbox folder for this task, and call it
hello_world.py.
● First, provide pseudo code as comments in your Python file, outlining
how you will solve this problem (you’ll need to read the rest of this
practical task first of course!).
● Now, inside your hello_world.py file, write Python code to take in a user’s
name using input() and then print out the name.
● Use the same input and output approach to take in a user’s age and
print it out.
● Finally, print the string “Hello World!” on a new line (the new line will
happen by default if you use a separate print statement to the one you
used immediately above to print out the age, because each print
statement automatically inserts an “enter”, or newline instruction, at the
end).

Practical Task 2
Follow these steps:
● Create a new Python file in the Dropbox folder for this task, and call it
details.py.
● As in practical task 1, please first provide pseudo code as comments in
your Python file, outlining how you will solve this problem.
● Use an input() command to get the following information from the
user.
○ Name
○ Age
○ House number
○ Street name
● Print out a single sentence containing all the details of the user.
● For example:
This is John Smith. He is 28 years old and lives at house
number 42 on Hamilton Street.

Practical Task 3
Follow these steps:
● Create a new Python file in this folder called conversion.py
● As in the previous practical tasks, please first provide pseudo code as
comments in your Python file, outlining how you will solve this problem.
● Declare the following variables:
○ num1 = 99.23
○ num2 = 23
○ num3 = 150
○ string1 = “100”
● Convert them as follows:
○ num1 into an integer
○ num2 into a float
○ num3 into a String
○ string1 into an integer
● Print out all the variables on separate lines
